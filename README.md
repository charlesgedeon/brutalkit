V0.1: Birth of Brutal Kit

## Description

The aim is to preserve the internet of old to teach a new generation the values of simplicity. Tags that are discriminated against by being either deprecated or obsolete will live on forever, here in brutal kit.

Brutal Kit will strip the oppressive modern browser of all its frills and bring the internet back to the stone age where it belongs.

Here are the supported tags as of this version:
- `<blink>`
- `<marquee>`
